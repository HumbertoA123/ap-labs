# Lab 1.1

## Description
For this lab I make my own version of cat.c, the file is called myCat.c. This file recieves and input file and prints what is on it.

## Instructions
To run the code jus compile it with `gcc myCat.c`, then you will have an a.out file.

Now you just tipe `./a.out`followed by the  file to be read, in this case I provided a text file called dummyText.txt so for this case we will type

`./a.out dummyText.txt`
