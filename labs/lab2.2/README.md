# Lab 2.2 - Logger Library

## Description
Implement a Logger library in C that will be used for printing the following types of messages.

- INFO General information.
- WARN Warnings.
- ERROR Errors.
- PANIC Panics. Non recoverable issues with core dump.


This logger library will be used instead of printf function calls in all new labs and challenges that we'll be doing in the course. Below you can see the prototype for each function.

## Instructions

This repository contains the logger.c file as well as its header file, logger.h. To test the program just compile testLogger.c and run it, the program will print different logs with their respective color..
